## FAQ

### 1.) Where should the data be persisted?

> A short-term in-memory storage mechanism such as localStorage or a simple array in NodeJS-land is fine.

### 2.) Should the final project be deployed to a public accessible server?

> This is not a requirement.

### 3.) Should the application provide user access and/or control features?

> This is not a requirement.

### 4.) Can I install additional dependencies?

> You can do whatever you feel is necessary, but please be prepared to explain your decisions.
